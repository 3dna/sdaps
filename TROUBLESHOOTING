What to do when things go wrong
===============================

Matrix could not be recognized
------------------------------

This means SDAPS could not find all four edge markers.

Please have a look at the following:
 * Check that the scan is OK.
   * Does it have black/white lines? This can happen in the scanner is not
     clean.
   * Check that the resolution is set to 300dpi
   * Check there is no black line at one side
   * Check that the line is nice and black in the image. If not you may be
     able to change LINE_COVERAGE in image.c to a lower value.
 * Measure the length and width of the corner marks in pixel. Try adjusting
   the "line_length" and "line_width" variables (image.c, calculate_matrix
   function).
   The most likely change is to lower line_length.


Recognition quality is bad
--------------------------

Load a lot of images into the project, then run
  $ sdaps project_dir boxgallery
Now look at the PDF file and find threshold values that work well for you.
The values need to be adjusted in recognize/buddies.py, where there is
something like:
 0.32 < coverage < 0.55
Which is the minimum and maximum value for a checked box.


Text boxes are recognized even though they are empty
----------------------------------------------------

There are different ways that this can happen. One thing that I have seen
happening is that the tolerance that SDAPS uses is not large enough, and it
thinks that the black frame around the box is actually handwriting. You can
adjust the padding to work around this. This can be done in
recognize/buddies.py in the Textbox class. Adjust the "padding" in the
recognize function.

If black dots, eg. from a cross on the other side of the paper are detect
too often, you can try to adjust test_width/test_height and coverage later
in the function.

If the above does not help
==========================

Mail the authors :-)
It may be neccessary to have all the data to help. So if you can try to
always provide examples where things fail.
