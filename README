SDAPS
=====

This Program can be used to carry out paper based surveys.

The questinaire is designed using OpenOffice.org and then exported to PDF.
SDAPS then uses both the ODT document and the PDF file to figure out what
questions are asked, and where checkboxes and freeform fields are placed.
After this, the program can create an arbitrary number of (unique)
questinaires that can be printed and handed out. After being filled out, you
just scan them in, let sdaps run over them, and let it create a report with
the results.


Requirements
============

 * Python (only tested with python 2.5)
 * GTK+ (for the front end that can be used to control/correct the results)
 * reportlab version 2.1
 * pdftk (recommended)
 * python-cairo (including development files)
 * libtiff (including development files)
 * python development files
 * pkg-config

Installation
============

SDAPS cannot currently be installed as a python module. Currently the best
way to go ahead is to just run it from its own directory.

Compiling the C extension
=========================

SDAPS uses a custom C extension for python to be able to handle the image
data efficiently. Thanks to this it is quite fast at what it does.

To compile the C module, go into the "image" subdirectory and run make. You
may need to install some software to be able to compile the module (see also
above). If the module is compiled for the wrong python version, replace the
python-config calls with calls to python2.x-config, or make sure
python-config corresponds to the correct python version that is used.

On sucess you an image.so file should be created, that can be imported into
python with "import image".


Using SDAPS
===========

Please run ./sdaps.py without arguments to see the options for now.

Quality of the recognition
==========================

The quality of the recognition of SDAPS is quite good. The algorithm just
tests for how much black is in the area of the box. This works pretty good,
with only a few mistakes in corner cases.
That said, this is based on results that the authors of this software had.
To achive these, we had our scanner set configured in a way that meant that
pretty much all pens or pencils turned out nice black. If you want to use
this software it is likely that you need to have a look at your scanners
option to find usable ones, and to also adjust the magic values that SDAPS
uses.
For this a tool called "boxgallery" is provided, which will output a sorted
list of all checkboxes. With this the threshold that is needed can be
determined.
