Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.1.2
==================================

This release brings a lot of small improvements, but also some new features.
The main new feature is the addition of a "convert" module, which can be used
to convert non-monochrome scans into monochrome images for later processing.
This module is also able to apply 3D-transformations as they are neccessary
when the source image was done using a camera.
This new module requires OpenCV. Note that using a feed scanner is still
prefered to this method.

Other changes include:
 * LaTeX: Fix compilation of large documents (by suppressing position output)
 * LaTeX: Fix multicolumn items and cline at the start of choicequestions
 * ODT: Custom styling in answers and question is now possible.
 * Various improvements and fixes in the corner mark detection code
 * New "custom" style which can be used when customizing the behaviour of SDAPS
 * A PDF with annotations will now be created if there was an error during setup
 * An issue in the base dir search code that affected OSX has been fixed
