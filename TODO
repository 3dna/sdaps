 * Aggregating multipage scans via the questionnaire ID. This can be usefull
   if you cannot guarantee that multipage questionnaires are scanned in
   the correct order.
 * Check that the correct pages are in a questionnaire (and not page one
   twice for example)
 * Improve detection when different scanners/printers are used in one
   project. The following possibilities come to mind:
   * Analyse a complete questionnaire at a time, to compare checkboxes.
   * Somehow remove the outline of the checkboxes at analysis time.
   * Use a line detection algorithm to detect crosses.
 * Calculate a recognition quality factor. This can be used for manual
   corrections for example.
